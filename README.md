# My First TypeScript Project 🎉

Hi everyone! 👋  

Welcome to my **first TypeScript project**! This is my very first hands-on experiment following what I’ve been learning in my TypeScript journey. Think of this as my sandbox where I explore, practice, and try out new things with TypeScript.  

I’m excited to take these first steps into building TypeScript projects, understanding types, interfaces, and all the basics that make coding safer and cleaner. 💻✨

## What This Project Is About

This project is a beginner-friendly exercise inspired by a tutorial I followed. Here’s what I’m practicing here:

- Writing TypeScript code with proper types  
- Using classes, functions, and interfaces  
- Organizing a small project structure  
- Compiling TypeScript to JavaScript and running it  

It’s simple, it’s fun, and it’s my way of learning by doing!

## How I Built This Project

Here’s a step-by-step explanation of what I did to get this project running:

1. **Installed UUID v4**  
   I started by installing `uuid` (v4) to generate unique IDs for each task in my to-do list. This ensures that every task has a distinct identifier, which is useful when adding, removing, or editing tasks.

2. **Used Vite as a Bundler**  
   I used **Vite** as the bundler for this project. A bundler combines all your TypeScript/JavaScript files, along with other assets, into a format that browsers can understand. Vite is fast, beginner-friendly, and makes development smoother with live reloading.

3. **Implemented a Simple To-Do List**  
   The main feature of this project is a small to-do list app where I can:
   - Add tasks   
   - Mark tasks as done  

4. **Saved Tasks in Local Storage**  
   I implemented a function to save all tasks to **local storage**, so even if I refresh the page, my tasks remain saved. This helps practice persisting data in the browser.

5. **Compiled TypeScript to JavaScript**  
   I converted my TypeScript files into JavaScript using the command:  
  
   npx tsc --project tsconfig.build.json

6. **Ran the Project Locally**  
   To run the project in development mode, I used:
  
   npm run dev
