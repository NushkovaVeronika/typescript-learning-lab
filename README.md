# Welcome to My TypeScript Journey! ðŸš€

Hi guys! ðŸ‘‹  

In this repository, I will be sharing my step-by-step journey learning **TypeScript** from scratch. This is my playground to explore, experiment, and get better at coding with TypeScript.  

Iâ€™m super excited to dive into this world, learning **Playwright with TypeScript** for QA testing, and everything else TypeScript has to offer.  

This is a beginner-friendly space, so feel free to follow along, give tips, or just say hi! ðŸŒŸ  

Happy coding! ðŸ’»ðŸ’›
