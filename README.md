# My First TypeScript Project 🎉

Hi everyone! 👋  

Welcome to my **first TypeScript project**! This is my very first hands-on experiment following what I’ve been learning in my TypeScript journey. Think of this as my sandbox where I explore, practice, and try out new things with TypeScript.  

I’m excited to take these first steps into building TypeScript projects, understanding types, interfaces, and all the basics that make coding safer and cleaner. 💻✨

## What This Project Is About

This project is a beginner-friendly exercise inspired by a tutorial I followed. Here’s what I’m practicing here:

- Writing TypeScript code with proper types  
- Using classes, functions, and interfaces  
- Organizing a small project structure  
- Compiling TypeScript to JavaScript and running it  

It’s simple, it’s fun, and it’s my way of learning by doing!
